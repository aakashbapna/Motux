# Motux
A simple Osmos clone using Flux, Sockets and Canvas. [See Demo](https://fathomless-river-3991.herokuapp.com/)

###Objective
My objective is to experiment with synced flux stores across clients.

Player's objective is to absorb smaller motes and avoid larger motes, in an attempt to become the largest.
